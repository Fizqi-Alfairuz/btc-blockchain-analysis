# [core]
# Specify a non-default location to store blockchain data.
blocksdir=~/.bitcoin/blocks
# Only download and relay blocks - ignore unconfirmed transaction
blocksonly=1
# Wait for initialization to be finished before exiting. This implies -daemon.
daemonwait=1
# Specify a non-default location to store blockchain and other data.
datadir=~/btc_blockchain_analysis/bitcoin/data
# Set database cache size in MB; machines sync faster with a larger cache. Recommend setting to 4000 if RAM is available.
dbcache=1000
# Reduce storage requirements by only storing most recent N MiB of block. This mode is incompatible with -txindex and -coinstatsindex. WARNING: Reverting this setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain. (default: 0 = disable pruning blocks, 1 = allow manual pruning via RPC, greater than 550 = automatically prune blocks to stay under target size in MiB).
prune=7000
# Maintain a full transaction index, used by the getrawtransaction rpc call.
txindex=1

# Most options automatically apply to mainnet, testnet, and regtest networks.
# If you want to confine an option to just one network, you should add it in the relevant section.
# EXCEPTIONS: The options addnode, connect, port, bind, rpcport, rpcbind and wallet
# only apply to mainnet unless they appear in the appropriate section below.
